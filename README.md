## What is bike sharing?
Bike sharing is a transportation service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis, typically for a small fee or for free in some cases. It offers a convenient and eco-friendly way to navigate urban areas, providing an alternative to traditional modes of transport like cars and public transit.

## Key Features of Bike Sharing:
- **Stations and Docks**: Bikes are typically available at designated docking stations located around a city or campus.
- **Dockless Systems**: Some modern bike-sharing systems use GPS-enabled bikes that can be picked up and dropped off anywhere within a service area, not just at specific stations.
- **Membership Options**: Users can often choose from various membership plans, including daily, monthly, or annual subscriptions.
- **Mobile Apps**: Most bike-sharing services offer mobile apps for finding, unlocking, and paying for bikes, making the process seamless and user-friendly.

## Benefits of Bike Sharing:
- **Reduces Traffic Congestion**: Helps alleviate traffic jams by providing an alternative to cars.
- **Promotes Physical Activity**: Encourages a healthy lifestyle by promoting regular physical exercise.
- **Environmentally Friendly**: Reduces carbon emissions and pollution by offering a green mode of transport.
- **Cost-Effective**: Often cheaper than owning a bike or using other forms of transport.
