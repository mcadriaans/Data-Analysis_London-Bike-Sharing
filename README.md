# London Bike sharing

## What is bike sharing?
Bike sharing is a transportation service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis, typically for a small fee or for free in some cases. It offers a convenient and eco-friendly way to navigate urban areas, providing an alternative to traditional modes of transport like cars and public transit.
