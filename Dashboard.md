# Tableau : London Bike Sharing (2015 - 2017)
I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize the key drivers of bike-sharing demand in London. The dashboard highlights critical patterns, such as the weekday commuter peaks and the strong impact of seasonality and weather. By enabling stakeholders to filter by season, they can explore how these patterns shift throughout the year, leading to better-informed decisions on bike allocation and marketing efforts.
